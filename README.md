# E-Commerce Web Application

## Description

Welcome to our E-Commerce web application! This project allows users to manage product categories, add and edit products with detailed information, and utilize a tagging system for additional product details. The application is built using Sequelize, MySQL, Insomnia, Express, and other technologies for seamless functionality.

The web application is pre-seeded with some initial information, providing users with a quick start. However, you have the flexibility to run the application without seeds for a fresh and customized experience.

Special thanks to Tabnine for their valuable assistance and support throughout the development process.
